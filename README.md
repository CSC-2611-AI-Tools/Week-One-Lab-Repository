### Problem 1: Two Sum
1. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up 
to target.
2. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may  not use the same element twice.
3. You can return the answer in any order.

### Problem 2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Problem 3: Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

### Problem 4: Roman to Integer
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. Roman numerals are usually 
written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number 
four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle
applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900. 
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

### Problem 5: Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, 
return an empty string "".
